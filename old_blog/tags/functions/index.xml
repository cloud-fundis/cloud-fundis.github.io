      <description>last time on jq Another way of producing a text list of running instances may be to push the fields we want though another jq function - join.
Lesson 10 Using functions There are a number of useful functions in jq that will make life a little easier. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore some of them.

      <description>Where were we? Lesson 7 Creating new structures Last time, we created a string from each of the outputs we were interested in using a combination of the pipe ( | ), the raw and compact flag and string interpolation with round braces:
jq -cr &#39;.Reservations[].Instances[] | &amp;quot;\(.InstanceId): \(.State.Name): \(.PrivateIpAddress)&amp;quot;&#39;  Perhaps we would like to create an array of the values. This is pretty simple because, in effect what we&amp;rsquo;re doing on the right hand side of the pipe ( | ) is to create a new structure.</description>
