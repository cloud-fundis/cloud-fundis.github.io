### T-shirt sizes
In BrightSpark, we define the concept of a t-shirt size to jobs. What this means is that jobs are categorized into small (S), medium (M), large (L), extra-large (XL), [and so forth] sized jobs. Running a job on a small t-shirt size might be 2 vCPUs and 8GB RAM while an XL may be 1 vCPUs and 128GB RAM. This allows one to define, in granular detail, the size of compute for a job.

Just like in other compute engines, specifying large compute for a small job, s wasteful of both compute and money. We encourage engineers to accurately specify their compute sizes.
