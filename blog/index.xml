      <description>S3 is a loverly beast. Store anything for as long as you like at virtually 0 cost.
There&amp;rsquo;s one thing I came across recently though that&amp;rsquo;s a real bind: object times are not transferrable.
That&amp;rsquo;s right, if you write an object now and tomorrow you want to move that object somewhere else, the time on the object cannot be transferred elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Yup, don&amp;rsquo;t have time to muck around. Need to be able to blog about things I learn so that I can use them later.
I think tjoef-tjaf is an Afrikaans expression meaning roughly, quick-quick. Here on Wikipedia are other &amp;lsquo;real Souf-Afrikan&amp;rsquo; words in common use - like ja-nee
Assumptions  Your blog Hugo metadata and all that junk lives in ~/somedir/myBlog/ If not, then you can use hugo to create a new site in ~/somedir as follows  In what follows, all my myBlogs live in ~/WorkDocs/cloudfundis/myBlog on my PC, and my githubpages repo is in ~/WorkDocs/cloudfundis/cloud-fundis.</description>

      <description>This week I am setting up my new laptop - moving off Mac finally and back onto Linux - YAY.
So one of the things I&amp;rsquo;m getting working is Visual Code Studio and Scala. Sounds easy doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Step 2 Scalameta is the extension for Scala on vscode. Install it; but wait, that&amp;rsquo;s not all - there&amp;rsquo;s more.
Of course you went for Step 1 which was &amp;ldquo;aaah, this is easy, just download the extension and you&amp;rsquo;re done.</description>
