      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since the last lesson. In that time, my computer died and was repaired and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got things back together.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to dive into more useful jq things, but also I&amp;rsquo;m going to refer to resources worth bookmarking.
First up: jqterm. This is a fantastic tool to test your queries iteractively. It does almost everything you could do in a terminal on your laptop, and gives immediate visual feedback.</description>

      <description>last time on jq Another way of producing a text list of running instances may be to push the fields we want though another jq function - join.
Lesson 10 Using functions There are a number of useful functions in jq that will make life a little easier. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore some of them.
join A function to join an array into a string. Whereas before we created a string using String iterpolation, we could simply use join.</description>

      <title>jq getting interesting: lessons 7 through 9</title>

      <description>Where were we? Lesson 7 Creating new structures Last time, we created a string from each of the outputs we were interested in using a combination of the pipe ( | ), the raw and compact flag and string interpolation with round braces:
jq -cr &#39;.Reservations[].Instances[] | &amp;quot;\(.InstanceId): \(.State.Name): \(.PrivateIpAddress)&amp;quot;&#39;  Perhaps we would like to create an array of the values. This is pretty simple because, in effect what we&amp;rsquo;re doing on the right hand side of the pipe ( | ) is to create a new structure.</description>

      <description>Previously on jq &amp;hellip; aws ec2 describe-instances | jq &#39;.Reservations[].Instances[] | keys&#39;  shows us all the keys for all the Reservations for all the Instances I have launched in AWS.
Perhaps we wish to know what the state of the instances are?
I see there&amp;rsquo;s a State in the resulting keys. Perhaps that has the state of all instances.
Lesson 3 JSON is case sensitive JSON is case sensitive, so</description>

      <description>After all your learnings and this series, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get to understand and write jq like the one below. It&amp;rsquo;s a culmination of our learnings:
jq &#39;def dotkeys: def stringify: map(tostring) | join(&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;); . as $in | reduce paths(scalars) as $p (null; ($in|getpath($p)) as $v | setpath([$p|stringify]; $v)); def chain(key): .[key] |= dotkeys ; chain(&amp;quot;AParticularNestedKey&amp;quot;)&#39; Yup, this looks terrible, even to me. So I&amp;rsquo;m on a quest and hopefully this&amp;rsquo;ll make more sense as these lessons progress.</description>

      <title>jq - first steps: a journey worth taking</title>

      <description>When I started at AWS, I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of jq before. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;d not been exposed to a lot of JSON either, so it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it or how unbelievably powerful it is.
This is a series of indefinite length that focusts on jq. Bascially, the man page is way too concise to be terribly helpful. This series will aim to fulfil two roles:
 To give practical examples of using jq, To act as a bit of a cookbook for &amp;lsquo;common&amp;rsquo; usecases.</description>
